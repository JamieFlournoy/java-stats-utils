Split the  library into  two modules:  a plain  JAR and  an additional  JAR that
depends on the plain jar, java-measure-utils, and JSR-363 things.

Tweaks to ConsoleHistogramFormatter:

- Change the bucketLabels in the histogram to not look cumulative (<=2, <=4
  implies that the second one includes the count in the first one). Make this
  clearer look the default, and make the narrower current look be available as
  an option.

- Add an optional empty-bucket trimming from output (no need to see smallest
  buckets w/ 0 count nor largest buckets w/ 0 count).

- Replace maxWidth's current meaning, which is a maxmimum number of stars in the
  histogram, with a meaning of total histogram width including labels and
  formatted counts.

- Change to a builder-style constructor (keep the class immutable, but return a
  new instance with the modified configuration).

- Add an example program showing how callers can autodetect the terminal width
in ConsoleHistogram*Formatter. (See
