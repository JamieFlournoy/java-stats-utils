# Pervasive Code's Java Statistics Utilities

This library includes classes for building and formatting histograms, and  for estimating task completion.

### Two libraries

This repository contains two Gradle subprojects, each of which generates a library published as a separate Maven artifact:

`com.pervasivecode:stats-utils:1.0`

and

`com.pervasivecode:stats-utils-measure-jsr363:1.0`.

The `stats-utils-measure-jsr363` is an extension of, and therefore depends on, the `stats-utils` library.

The `stats-utils-measure-jsr363` library is separate because it provides additional classes compatible with the [JSR 363 Units of Measurement API](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=363), which provides for a type-safe Java representation of quantities with units (such as "a mass of 8 kilograms", as opposed to a plain `int` value of 8). Because of this, `stats-utils-measure-jsr363` has additional dependencies on several JSR-363-related libraries. If you don't want to use those classes, then you don't need to depend on the `stats-utils-measure-jsr363` library from your project, and can just depend on the `stats-utils` library.

## Overview of included classes

Javadocs are available on `javadoc.io`:

For stats-utils:
[![Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.pervasivecode/stats-utils.svg)](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.pervasivecode/stats-utils)

For stats-utils-measure-jsr363:
[![Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.pervasivecode/stats-utils-measure-jsr363.svg)](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.pervasivecode/stats-utils-measure-jsr363)

See the separate [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) file for a description of what interfaces and classes are included. (Overview content is taken from class Javadoc comments, so there's no need to read both.)

## Including it in your project

### Stats-utils:

Use groupId `com.pervasivecode`, name `stats-utils`, version `1.0` in your build tool of choice.

### Stats-utils-measure-jsr363:

Use groupId `com.pervasivecode`, name `stats-utils-measure-jsr363`, version `1.0` in your build tool of choice.


### Gradle Example

If you are using Gradle 4.x, put this in your build.properties file:

```
// in your build.gradle's repositories {} block:
    mavenCentral();

// in your build.gradle's dependencies {} block:
    implementation 'com.pervasivecode:stats-utils:1.0'

    // and optionally
    implementation 'com.pervasivecode:stats-utils-measure-jsr363:1.0'

// or, if you prefer the separated group/name/version syntax:
    implementation group: 'com.pervasivecode', name: 'stats-utils', version: '1.0'

    // and optionally
    implementation group: 'com.pervasivecode', name: 'stats-utils-measure-jsr363', version: '1.0'
```
